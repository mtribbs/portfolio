          "Therese was one of my students in IT: Tech for Women at Sundsgårdens
          Folkhögskola in 2021. I really enjoyed teaching Therese. Her
          dedication to learning as much as she could was inspiring. Even when
          faced with very difficult technical issues, Therese always kept
          pushing and was determined to solve each problem. During the course
          she often asked complex questions that showed a deeper understanding
          for what we were studying. She was always quick to turn in assignments
          and her code was of good quality. It was easy to see that Therese
          understood the connection between the theory and practical application
          while programming which allowed her to write well-functioning code. I
          wish Therese the best of luck in her future as a developer and hope
          our paths will cross again."
